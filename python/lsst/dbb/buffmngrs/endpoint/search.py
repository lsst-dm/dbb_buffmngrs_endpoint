    """Generate the file names based on the content of the rsync logs.

    This is a specialized search method for finding files which where
    transferred to the storage area by ``rsync``. It identifies these
    files by parsing ``rsync``'s log files. It assumes that:

    1. The logs are stored in a centralized location.
    2. Logs from different days are kept in different subdirectories in that
       location.
    3. The name of each subdirectory represents the date when
       files where transferred and that date is expressed as ``YYYYMMDD``.
    4. Log files contain file paths relative to the root of the storage area.

    After the function completed parsing a given logfile, it creates an
    empty file ``<logfile>.<extension>`` which act as a sentinel preventing it
    from parsing the file again.

    As the files from a single observation night can be placed in different
    directories and these directories can be created in a time zone
    different from the one the endpoint site operates in, be default the
    function monitors also log files in directories corresponding to a day
    before and a day after the current day (if any of them exists).  This
    default settings determining which directories will be monitored can be
    changed by adjusting ``past_days`` and ``future_days`` options (see
    below).

    Parameters
    ----------
    directory : `str`
        The directory where the all log files reside.
    exclude_list : `list` of `str`, optional
        List of regular expressions file names should be match against. If a
        filename matches any of the patterns in the list, file will be ignored.
        By default, no file is ignored.
    isodate : `str`, optional
        String representing ISO date corresponding the directory which the
        function should monitor for new logs. If None (default), it will be set
        to the current date.
    past_days : `int`, optional
        The number of past days to add to the list of monitored directories.
        Defaults to 1.
    future_days : `int`, optional
        The number of future days to add to the list of monitored directories.
        Defaults to 1.
    delay : `int`, optional
        Time (in seconds) that need to pass from log's last modification before
        it will be considered fully transferred. By default, it is 60 s.
    extension : `str`, optional
        An extension to use when creating a sentinel file. Defaults to "done".

    Yields
    ------
    path : `string`
        A file path extracted from the log files.
