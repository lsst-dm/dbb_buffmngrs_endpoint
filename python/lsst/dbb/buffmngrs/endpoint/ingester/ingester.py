class Ingester(object):
    """Framework managing image ingest process.

    Ingester manages the process of ingesting images to different database
    systems.

    It may operate in one of two modes: daemonic and non-daemonic. In the
    default daemonic mode, it waits for new files and when they arrive it
    attempts to ingest each file to a given database system.  In the
    non-daemonic mode, it will terminate once it process all files with a
    specified status.
